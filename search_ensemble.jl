    ensemble_search(vars, data; num_runs::Int=20, threshold::Float64=0.5, hybrid_options::NamedTuple)

Performs an ensemble of hybrid searches to build a high-confidence graph.
1. Runs 'fast_hybrid_search' 'num_runs' times.
2. Counts the frequency of each edge appearing in the results.
3. Builds a final graph containing only edges that appeared with a frequency >= 'threshold'.
